# Contributing Requirements

When creating or updating CONTRIBUTING.md files for starter apps, use the template from:

**Reference:** `@project-template/CONTRIBUTING.md`

This template includes:
- Prerequisites and installation instructions (Node.js/pnpm focused)
- Bug reporting guidelines
- Enhancement suggestion process
- Pull request requirements
- Security scanning requirements
- Community connection channels

## Project-Specific Customizations

Adjust the following based on your project:
- Update installation commands if not using pnpm
- Add language-specific security scanning commands
- Include any special SDK setup requirements (see lines 128-141 for template)
- Add cloud provider setup steps if applicable (see lines 105-126 for template)
