# Security Requirements

When creating or updating SECURITY.md files for starter apps, use the template from:

**Reference:** `@project-template/SECURITY.md`

This template includes:
- Link to Deepgram's main security policy
- Supply chain security measures (Node.js focused, but adaptable)
- Package manager security configurations
- Dependency pinning strategy
- Snyk integration and local security checks
- Lockfile protection practices
- Security issue reporting procedures

## Project-Specific Customizations

Adjust the following based on your project:

### For AWS/Cloud Projects
Add after "Dependency Pinning Strategy" section:

**AWS Credentials Security:**
- Never commit `.env` with real credentials
- Use IAM roles when possible
- Rotate access keys regularly
- Use least-privilege IAM policies
- Store credentials in environment variables
- Use AWS Secrets Manager for production

**Required IAM Permissions:**
- Document minimum required permissions for your service

### For Local SDK Dependencies
Add to "Dependency Pinning Strategy" section if using local file references:
- Explain the local SDK path configuration
- Document directory structure requirements
- Note that paths may need adjustment per developer
- Indicate when SDK will be replaced with npm version
