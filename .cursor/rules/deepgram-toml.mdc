# deepgram.toml Requirements

## File Purpose

The `deepgram.toml` file configures project metadata and build steps for the Deepgram CLI. It enables automated setup and deployment of starter applications.

## TOML  Config Sections

### [meta] Section

Every deepgram.toml must have this section. Describes the project, doesn't affect build/runtime.

[meta]
title = "Project Title"                    # REQUIRED: Short, descriptive title
description = "Brief description"          # REQUIRED: One-line description
author = "Deepgram DX Team <devrel@deepgram.com> (https://developers.deepgram.com)"  # REQUIRED: Always use this
useCase = "STT"                           # REQUIRED: See valid values below
language = "TypeScript"                    # REQUIRED: Primary language
framework = "Node"                         # OPTIONAL: Framework/runtime (omit if none)
sdk = "3.8.12"                            # OPTIONAL: Deepgram SDK version (omit if not used)**Valid `useCase` values:**

**UseCases**
- `STT` - Speech-to-Text / Transcription
- `TTS` - Text-to-Speech / Audio AI
- `Agent` - Voice Agent applications
- `TextIntel` - Text Intelligence / Analyze API
- `Live-STT` - Live streaming transcription
- `Live-TTS` - Live streaming text-to-speech

### Installation and Build Steps

Use when dependencies need installation before building.

[pre-build]
command = "pnpm run install:all"           # Command to install dependencies
message = "Dependencies installed"         # Success message to display### [build] Section (OPTIONAL)
Use when project requires compilation/build step.

[build]
command = "pnpm build"                     # Build command
message = "Build completed"                # Success message### [build.config] Section (OPTIONAL)
Use when project needs environment file setup.

[build.config]
sample = "sample.env"                      # Template env file
output = ".env"                            # Output env file### [post-build] Section (OPTIONAL)
Display instructions after build completes.

[post-build]
message = "Run `pnpm start` to get started."  # Instructions for user## Language-Specific Examples

## Guidelines
1. **Always include `[meta]` section** with all required fields
2. **Use `[pre-build]`** if dependencies need installation
3. **Use `[build]`** if project requires compilation
4. **Use `[build.config]`** for environment variable setup (most projects need this)
5. **Use `[post-build]`** to provide clear next steps for users
6. **Omit optional sections** if not needed (e.g., no build step for interpreted languages)
7. **Match commands to package manager** - don't use pnpm for Python projects!
